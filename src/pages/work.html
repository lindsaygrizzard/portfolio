                    Vonndaâ€™s website won awards when it was first released in 2010, but like many agencies focused on clients, had fallen far out of date with updated design trends. I rebuilt their website from the ground up using Typo3 initially and then switching to Wordpress in the end. I also crafted a well designed brand that felt fresh and on point with their mission to be one of the best adaptive, professional and efficient, web design and development agencies in San Francisco.

                    V1 of vonnda.com is out and already a vast improvement over the previous design but as we continue to make Vonnda a stronger brand, we have been running interaction tests and combing through the site for both code and design improvements.

                <p class="work-secondary-para para white-font">
                    This is one small example of a v2 mobile improvement that we predict will have a significant impact on mobile users of the site based on testing results observed. Users seemed to be confused about what was a link and what wasn't because of well intentioned design choices. In v2 we have removed colored titles if something is not a link and tried to make mobile links more easily identifiable.

                    At 500friends, I took the lead on a marketing website redesign, product design and branding updates.  I created a robust living style guide that is still used by the product and marketing team to keep a consistent brand guideline -a pain point experienced by the company before. I also heavily contributed to miscellaneous print design, whitepapers, icons and strategy deck design.

                    My favorite type of design and development work are the interactive pieces that help users navigate and understand context. At 500friends I had the opportunity to build several of these moments throughout the site and fine tuned them based on user interaction research.
